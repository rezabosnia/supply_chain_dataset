<!-- PROBLEM STATEMENT -->
<h2 id="about-the-project"> PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>

Supply chain industries often face challenges such as fraudulent orders, resulting in significant financial losses. This project aims to tackle these issues by leveraging machine learning to detect patterns in order history, supplier reliability, and transaction anomalies. By applying predictive models to past records, we aim to reduce fraud risks and optimize resource allocation. To demonstrate this, we use a supply chain dataset (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8gx2fvg2k6/5) by Constante, Silva, & Pereira (2019). The model development and methodology were influenced by insights from a Kaggle project  (https://www.kaggle.com/code/skloveyyp/comparison-of-classification-regression-rnn) by Shu (2021).

We will implement various traditional machine learning algorithms alongside a neural network model. Neural networks are well-suited for classification problems, as demonstrated by their effectiveness in credit scoring applications (Edmond & Girsang, 2020). We will evaluate the performance of neural networks against traditional machine learning models to determine which approach is more effective for fraud detection.
